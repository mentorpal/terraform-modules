# Content
This repository contains Terraform modules.

All modules have their description in their directory.

## How to set pre-commit hooks
Follow documentation at https://github.com/antonbabenko/pre-commit-terraform and https://pre-commit.com/

TLDR - just run one time only (after cloning the repo)
```zsh
brew install pre-commit #install pre-commit
pre-commit install # configure pre-commit for current repository
```
